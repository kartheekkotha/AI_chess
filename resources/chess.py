#Ensure that Pygame is installed

#GUI inspired by:
#https://en.lichess.org/

#Chess board image was taken from lichess website as well.
#The images for the pieces came from:
#https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Chess_Pieces_Sprite.svg/2000px-Chess_Pieces_Sprite.svg.png

#AI ideas from:
#https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/

# An online lecture that helped me understand alpha-beta pruning:
# Winston, P. [MIT OpenCourseWare]. (2010) 6. Search: Games, Minimax,
# and Alpha-Beta. [Video File]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik

#Special thanks to professor Saquib for being so amazing.

# This program is a chess game. The user may play against a friend or the
# computer.
#
# The game state is mainly stored as a 2D list of strings, and most of the
# processing is thus done on a list of strings.
#
# The GUI takes the current state and displays it on the screen. The GUI allows
# drag and drop movement of pieces as well as click-click movement.
#
# The AI that plays against the human evaluates all possible moves made by either
# player up to a certain level of depth. The AI evaluates each position by giving
# it a score. The higher the value of the score, the more favourable a position
# is for white and the lower the value of the score, the more favourable the
# position is for black. Knowing that white will try to get the score to be higher
# and black will try and get the score to be lower, the AI assumes best play from
# either side as it traverses up the search tree and chooses the best move to be
# played. A problem that may arise is the number of postions that need to be
# evaulated. Even at 3 levels of depth, thousands of positions have to be
# evaluatd.
# Several methods are used in this program to reduce positions that are searched:
# 1. Alpha-beta pruning: As a result of  evaluating a position it can be found
# that a portion of the search tree can be ignored as no further evaluations can
# guarantee better results. This can happen because white and black area against
# one another. White plays what is best for it and black plays what is best for it,
# so it would make sense for white to ignore any portion of the tree where black
# has a clear upperhand that it can choose to play.
# 2. Transposition table: Often, two different pathways in a search tree can result
# in the same board being evaluated. Instead of evaluating the same board several
# times, the program stores a table of values in a dictionary where the keys are
# the positions. This way, repeated positions can have their evaluations looked up
# fairly quickly, as the board state is hashed.
# 3. Opening Book - The opening book is again a dictionary that stores board
# positions often seen in the beginning few moves in chess. Appropraite moves that
# can be played at such positions is stored in the dictionary. A random move is
# selected and played from the list of suggested moves wihtout searching if the AI
# finds itself confronting a such a board postion. Note that this opening book was
# recorded by myself and so it does not have many positions stored in it.
#
# In order to traverse the search tree as above, the AI needs to know how to evaluate the
# board at any position to decide if white or black has the advantage. My evaluation
# function currently looks at three main things when evaluating the board:
#    a) Material for white and black. Each piece has a value and the more pieces you have,
#        the better off your position is likely to be. For example, if white has an extra
#        queen, it has an advantage over black.
#    b) Piece-square table values - for each piece, there is a table that stores the best
#        squares that the particular piece should occupy. So if white has a knight at a
#        good square that controls the centre of the board, whereas black has a knight
#        at the corner of the board, the situation is evaluated as being more favourable
#        for white.
#    c) Reduction in points for doubled pawns, isolated pawns, and blocked pawns. If any
#        side has a set of pawns with the above features their points are slightly lower
#        to indicate a slight disadvantage in such a position.
#    d) A checkmate: a position where this has occured gets a very high point, so that the
#        AI moves towards this if it can. (or avoids it).
#
# There are also several ways in which this program may be improved:
# 1. Move ordering: Given a certain position and the AI needs to search a few layers
# deep from it, somehow pre-sorting each move by ranking them in their likelihood of
# being good moves allows for earlier cut-offs to be made by alpha-beta pruning.
# 2. Iterative Deepening: Instead of going directly to a given depth when searching,
# the A.I. may evaluate the best move at depth 1, then depth 2, then depth 3, etc.
# until it reaches the final depth it needed to calculate at depth n. The reason for
# this is that it may be mathematically shown that this does not dignificantly increase
# computation and allows the A.I. to make its best move if it needs to abide by a
# time limit.
# 3. Better data structure - I believe the structure I have used to keep the state of
# the board (list of a list) may be slowing down accessing its elements or assigning
# its elements. Improvement in efficiency of my code by changing data structures may
# potentially improve the speed at which my AI makes its move.
# 4. Import of large opening tables: There are databases available online that store
# the best moves played by grandmasters at various key opening positions of the chess
# game. Although my AI does make use of an opening table that I recorded for it myself,
# it is not able to respond to many opening positions using the table since the table
# only convers few positions. If an opening table with millions of positions could be
# imported to this program, the AI's moves would improve in the beginning. It would also
# give it more variety in terms of the move it plays. Furthermore, using good openings
# allows the AI to make the best moves in the field it is best at: middle game tactics.
# 5. Better evaluation of positions - The current features evaluated by the evaluation
# function when judging a positoin to give it a score allows for good opening games and
# tactics that often allow it to gain advantage over the opponents that I have tested it
# against. However, there are many aspects of playing good chess that it does not
# consider: like having good mobility of your pieces (eg a trapped bishop should be bad
# for the AI but it doesn't know that). Other aspects include king safety, pawn structure,
# etc. It could also use different evaluation for each game phase. For example, a pawn is
# not worth much at the opening phase of the game but in the endgame it is very important
# and so should be evaulated as a valuable piece.
# 6. Endgame tables - As good as my AI may be in middle games, given a queen and a king to
# attempt checkmate against a lone king, it would be unlikely for it to succeed. This is
# because such checkmates, despite being simple, require a large number of combination of
# moves to occur, the depth of which my AI would not be able to see. So endgame table allows
# it to know (for a very large number of endgame positions) the best move to play in order
# to attempt a win or a draw (or try its best to avoid a loss).


#Note about coordinates:
#Normally, algebraic notation is used to specify a box on a chess board. In this
#program, coordinates will be index referecnes to the 2_D array that stores the
#state of the board. Thus, e4 in algebraic notation would be expressed as (4,4)
#in this program.

#Class Definitions:
#####################################################
#There are three classes used in this program:
# 1. GamePosition - This class stores a chess position. A chess position constitutes several
# features that specify the state of the game, such as the the player that has to play next,
# castling rights of the players, number of irreversible moves played so far, the positions of
# pieces on the board, etc.
# 2. Shades - This is used for GUI. A shade is a transparent colored image that is displayed on
# a specific square of the chess board, in order to show various things to the user such as
# the squares to which a piece may move, the square that is currently selected, etc. The class
# stores a reference to the image that the instance of the class should display when needed. It
# also stores the coordinates at which the shade would be applied.
# 3. Piece - This is also used for GUI. A Piece object stores the information about the image
# that a piece should display (pawn, queen, etc.) and the coordinate at which it should be
# displayed on thee chess board.

#Function Definitions:
#####################################################

# The functions in this file may be classified into three main groups:
# 1. Chess Processing Functions - these are the functions that work with variables
# that hold the information about game state.
# 2. GUI Functions - These are the functions that work together to display the
# chess board to the user and get the user's input as well, so that they may be
# passed on to the Chess Processing Functions.
# 3. AI related functions - These are the functions involved in helping the
# computer make decisions in terms of what should be played.

#///////////////////////////////CHESS PROCESSING FUNCTIONS////////////////////
#
# drawText(board) - This function is not called in this program. It is useful for debugging
# purposes, as it allows a board to be printed to the screen in a readable format.
#
# isOccupied(board,x,y) - Returns true if a given coordinate on the board is not empty, and
# false otherwise.
#
# isOccupiedby(board,x,y,color) - Same as above, but only returns true if the square
# specified by the coordinates is of the specifc color inputted.
#
# filterbyColor(board,listofTuples,color) - This function takes the board state, a list
# of coordinates, and a color as input. It will return the same list, but without
# coordinates that are out of bounds of the board and also without those occupied by the
# pieces of the particular color passed to this function as an argument. In other words,
# if 'white' is passed in, it will not return any white occupied square.
#
# lookfor(board,piece) - This functions takes the 2D array that represents a board and finds 
# the indices of all the locations that is occupied by the specified piece. The list of 
# indices is returned.
#
# isAttackedby(position,target_x,target_y,color) - This function checks if the square specified
# by (target_x,target_y) coordinates is being attacked by any of a specific colored set of pieces.
#
# findPossibleSquares(position,x,y,AttackSearch=False) - This function takes as its input the
# current state of the chessboard, and a particular x and y coordinate. It will return for the
# piece on that board a list of possible coordinates it could move to, including captures and 
# excluding illegal moves (eg moves that leave a king under check). AtttackSearch is an
# argument used to ensure infinite recursions do not occur.
#
# makemove(position,x,y,x2,y2) - This function makes a move on the board. The position object
# gets updated here with new information. (x,y) are coordinates of the piece to be moved, and
# (x2,y2) are coordinates of the destination. (x2,y2) being correct destination (ie the move
# a valid one) is not checked for and is assumed to be the case.
#
# opp(color) - Returns the complimentary color to the one passed. So inputting 'black' returns
# 'w', for example.
#
# isCheck(position,color) - This function takes a position as its input and checks if the
# King of the specified color is under attack by the enemy. Returns true if that is the case, 
# and false otherwise.
#
# isCheckmate(position,color=-1) - This function tells you if a position is a checkmate.
# Color is an optional argument that may be passed to specifically check for mate against a
# specific color.
#
# isStalemate(position) - This function checks if a particular position is a stalemate.
# If it is, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.
#
# getallpieces(position,color) - This function returns a list of positions of all the pieces on
# the board of a particular color.
#
# allMoves(position, color) - This function takes as its argument a position and a color/colorsign
# that represents a side. It generates a list of all possible moves for that side and returns it.
#
# pos2key(position) - This function takes a position as input argument. For this particular 
# position, it will generate a unique key that can be used in a dictionary by making it hashable.
#

##/////////////////////////////////////////////GUI FUNCTIONS////////////////////////////////
# chess_coord_to_pixels(chess_coord) - This function takes as input a chess coordinate such as
# (4,7). It returns the top left corner pixel at which a piece of the given size should be
# placed on the board for it to appear at the correct square.
#
# pixel_coord_to_chess(pixel_coord) - Does the exact opposite of above, namely taking the 
# pixel coordinate and giving back the chess coordinate of a particular square.
#
# getPiece(chess_coord) - Gives back the reference to the Piece object that occupies
# a particular chess coordinate.
#
# createPieces(board) - Loops through all the pieces in the inputted board array
# and creates an instance of Piece class for each of them. Returns a list of two
# lists: one that contains all the references to the white pieces, and the other 
# for black.
#
# createShades(listofTuples) - This will modify the global list listofShades. It
# will create instance of class Shade for all the specified coordinates given in
# listofTuples (the input argument). These squares are ones that are attacked by
# a particular piece. Furthermore, it will append other appropriate shades as well,
# such as shades used to show checkmate or stalemate.
#
# drawBoard() - Blits to the screen the board, the pieces, and the shades needed
# to make the game look nice.
#

##//////////////////////////////////////AI RELATED FUNCTIONS////////////////////////////////
#
# negamax(position,depth,alpha,beta,colorsign,bestMoveReturn,root=True) - This 
# function takes as its inputs a position, and a depth to which moves should be 
# analysed. It will generate moves and analyse resulting positions to decide the
# best move to be played for the AI. Alpha and beta are lower and upper bounds to
# a position's possible
# score values and allows for alpha-beta pruning. Colorsign indicates the player
# to move. bestMoveReturn is a list that will be assigned the move to be played.
# Returning is not possible in this case because threading is used. root is a 
# variable that keeps track of whether the original node is processing now or a 
# lower node. Alpha beta pruning is not explained in detail here so I recommend
# learning more about it if the code does not make sense.
# Note that the function does not always traverse a tree to give back the move
# to be played by the AI. It also checks the opening table to see if there is a 
# prerecorded move that it can play without searching. Scoring of each position
# is also stored in a global dictionary to allow for time-saving if the same 
# position occurs elsewhere in the tree. The code used here is adapted from the 
# pseudocode provided at Wikipidea:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax#Negamax_with_alpha_beta_pruning
#
# evaluate(position) - This function takes as input a position to be analysed.
# It will look at the positioning of pieces on the board to judge whether white
# has an advantage or black. If it returns zero, it means it considers the 
# position to be equal for both sides. A positive value is an advantage to the
# white side and a negative value is an advantage to the black side.
#
# pieceSquareTable(flatboard,gamephase) - Gives a position a score based solely
# on tables that define points for each position for each piece type.
#
# doubledPawns(board,color) - This function counts the number of doubled pawns
# for a player and returns it. Doubled pawns are those that are on the same file.
#
# blockedPawns(board,color) - This function counts the number of blocked pawns
# for a player and returns it. Blocked pawns are those that have a piece in front
# of them and so cannot advance forward.
#
# isolatedPawns(board,color) - This function counts the number of isolated pawns
# for a player. These are pawns that do not have supporting pawns on adjacent files
# and so are difficult to protect.
